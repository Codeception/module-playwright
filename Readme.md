# Playwright module for Codeception

ðŸš€ This is the **first and the only library that features [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) testing in PHP**. Playwright allows testing in Chrome, Firefox, Webkit (safari). It is faster and more reliable alternative to Selenium WebDriver. Finally it is available in PHP!

This module does not implement Playwright API in PHP, rather proxies requests to Playwright helper of [CodeceptJS](https://codecept.io). This is possible because Codeception and CodeceptJS share the same architecture principles, and the interface for web testing is quite the same.

> [!Warning]
> This module is experimental. It is in early development stage. Please report any issues you find.

> [!Note]
> This module can be used as a drop-in replacement for Codeception's [module WebDriver](https://codeception.com/docs/modules/WebDriver). Comparing to WebDriver, Playwright can **speed up your tests x3 times**, run in headless mode, record videos and stack traces out of the box
> Since this module provides the same API as module WebDriver, you can use it in your tests without any changes.

## Requirements

* PHP 8.1+
* [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/)

## Installation

Install the Node.js part of this module; this will install Playwright and CodeceptJS:
```bash
npm install codeception-module-playwright
```
Install Playwright browsers
```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps
```
Install the PHP part of this module:
```bash
composer require codeception/module-playwright --dev
```

## Configuration

Enable the module in `Acceptance.suite.yml`:

```yaml
modules:
    enabled:
        - Playwright:
            url: 'http://localhost' # Base url to open pages from
            browser: 'chromium' # Either `chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`
            show: true # Show the browser (=default) or run tests in headless mode
            timeout: 5000 # Timeout (in ms) for all Playwright operations. Default: 5000
            pw_start: true # Start Playwright server (proxy to CodeceptJS) automatically. Set to `false` and run the server manually in case the server doesn't start.
            pw_server: http://localhost:8191 # Url of Playwright server. Default: http://localhost:8191
            pw_debug: false # Print Playwright server debug information. Default: false

            # Not implemented yet:
            video: true # Save video on fail
            trace: true # Save stack traces on fail
```
More configuration options are listed on [CodeceptJS Playwright page](https://codecept.io/helpers/Playwright/#configuration)

> [!Tip]
> If you're switching from WebDriver, just change `WebDriver` to `Playwright` and see how it works!

## Usage

Playwright module requires the Node.js server to be running. Playwright module will start it and stop automatically. Default port is **8191**.

If you want to disable automatic server start, set `start` option to `false`:

```yaml
modules:
    enabled:
        - Playwright:
            url: 'http://localhost'
            browser: 'chromium'
            show: true
            pw_start: false
```

In this case you can start the server manually:

```bash
npx codeception-playwright-module
```
Please check that server can be started with no issues.

If you start server on different host or port, you can configure it:

```yaml
modules:
    enabled:
        - Playwright:
            url: 'http://localhost'
            browser: 'chromium'
            show: true
            pw_start: false
            pw_server: http://otherhost:8191
```

## API

Besides supporting all commands of Module Webdriver, there are Playwright-specific commands available in [CodeceptJS Playwright Helper](https://codecept.io/helpers/Playwright/).

## Example

```php
$I->amOnPage('/');
$I->click('#first .clickable');
$I->dontSeeInTitle('Error');
$I->see('Hello, world!');
```
